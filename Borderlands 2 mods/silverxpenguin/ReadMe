I just want to share a few things that I find are fun. 

I have more things, but a lot of them are heavily based off of, or modified versions of other people's work and I haven't gotten around to asking any of them.
-----------------------------------------------------
So just a bit about these mods:

I usually have the game running artificially on a harder difficulty, so these mods were made in that enviroment (think Hemaxhu's FFYLL2 style of thing).

I've tried to balance them back down a little so they aren't super OP, but if you're looking at modded gear, you weren't looking for a vanilla gameplay experience anyway. 
------------------------------------------------------
Feel free to take anything and use it or mold it into what you need, heaven knows I've taken single lines of code many times because I didn't feel like doing it myself. 

If you do plan on using any of my content in something of your own (if there is anyone still making  new content) you don't need to give me any credit, but it would be nice.

ENJOY!!
