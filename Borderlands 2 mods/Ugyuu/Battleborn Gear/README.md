# BATTLEBORN

FOR EVERY KIND OF BADASS

This is a collection of gear representing some Battleborn characters.

Note: These weapons are more powerful than your usual gun, but attempts have been made to balance them.
Despite that, use these at your own risk if you don't like 'strong' guns.

This gear is made to replicate the character's skills / weapons in some way, put into a single piece of gear made for them.

Melee characters not included.
