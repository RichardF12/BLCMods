For info on the mods in much greater detail than what I could explain here, just check this link out.

For the Bank And Backpack Space Enhancer there are two files.

Part 1, also known as the "Activator", is the only thing you will add to any of your mod packs.
This simply enables special actions caused by Tab, I (eye), and E.  These keys retain their normal functionality.


Part 2, also known as the "Customizer", you do NOT add to any of your mod packs.  Instead, you customize it with BLCMM!
This mod MUST be added to your Binaries directory for BL2!
This will allow you to customize your Bank and Backpack Space in various ways with individual options.

These options are as follows:
Make your Backpack Space be a total of 40 at the Default option, all the way up to 200 capacity.
Make your Bank/Vault Space be a total of 40 at the Default option, all the way up to 200 capacity.
Make your Backpack have "Unlimited" capacity*, which doesn't change the size but rather you can keep picking up loot.

I limited the capacity to 200 due to negative impacts on game-play in terms of loading your Backpack and Bank.
There is an issue with the "Unlimited Backpack Space", which is the fact that you cannot buy items from Vendors past your default or modified Backpack capacity.


*Be warned, this option can have adverse effects on game-play.
