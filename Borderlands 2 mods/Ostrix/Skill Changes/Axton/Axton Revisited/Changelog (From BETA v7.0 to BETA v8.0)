NOTE: THE FOLLOWING CHANGES APPLY BETWEEN UPDATES BETA V7.0 TO BETA V8.0
This is the Balance and Tweaks + Fixes Update.


Miscellaneous Changes:

Deleted the Misc Category and put its contents into a new category in "Skills" called "Sabre Turret" (Above Crisis Management and other Players Choice Skill Changes).

Swapped Skill Locations of Bulletstorm/Pelt and Duty Calls for Balancing.

Fixed so that Class Mods will display the Correct names for custom Skills (i.e Bulletstorm, Criticals Kill, Reap And Regenerate, etc).

STILL trying to knock down hotfix names of ASOverhaul (Remnants of the mod's former name). This doesn't affect Gameplay, but just noted for the heck of it.

Skill Changes:

Expertise: Now increases Accuracy (Passive effect) instead of Movement Speed while aiming down Sights. This allowed for the next change...

Criticals Kill: Now increases Critical Hit Damage Further (Multiplicative Bonus) while Aiming down Sights, instead of increasing Accuracy.

Reap And Regenerate: Fixed Skill being a Kill Skill instead of Passive as it should be. Also made the skill the only option of modification for Forbearance, since the other option didn't compare at all (Like how Bulletstorm and Pelt used to be). This will be changed again in a later update, once I figure out what I wanna do with it for competition.

Auto Repair: Buffed the Health Regeneration (And also found out that Health Regen is not boosted by Titanium Turret) by an additional 3% per point, and changed the way the UI Displays it.

Bulletstorm: Replaced Recoil Reduction with a small chance (6% Per Point) for YOUR Bullets (As in, this does NOT apply to the Turrets Bullets) to ricochet off enemies. With a Class Mod, this could make a literal Bullet Storm.

Ranger: Replaced Fire Rate Bonus with Movement Speed Bonus, and Actually made the Gun and Grenade Damage Bonuses (And now all other bonuses) Multiplicative. Additionally, UI has been Tweaked for both Standalone and Compatibility Mode. These should further increase this Skill's worth without making it too good. I've also learned that setting any Fire Rate Bonus to Multiplicative... Makes you fire ridiculously fast.


Class Mods:

Legendary Grenadier: Replaced Grenade Regeneration with Gun Damage Reduction. This was done so the Class Mod would no longer be as Overpowered.


And there are other, minor changes not listed here because of the following reasons: Doesn't affect Gameplay, extremely minor change, or (Most likely, but there's also some Non gameplay changing edits) the simple fact that I forgot about it.

Now, for a little tidbit on what goes though my mind while making this mod (And other mods, of course).
Bulletstorm vs Pelt: My Thought process and the pros and cons.

Both of these skills aim to kill enemies in fewer trigger pulls on your end. These skills accomplish that in different ways.

Bulletstorm:
(I had it at 7% per point at first, but put it down to 6% because with the right Class Mod, you could make it guaranteed (At least with my modpack). No, I didn't test it in Gameplay first, I mathed.)
I wanted to buff Bulletstorm instead of Nerfing Pelt and ended up doing it this way because there really was no competition between them, with Pelt being Objectively better.
Why didn't I Nerf Pelt instead, you ask? Well, because I'd rather promote Player Choice (heh) by buffing the weaker item in question than nerfing the stronger. I did the opposite of what the TPS Developers did for some weapons.

Pros:
You can literally run through an area, and if you have the skill at a high grade, you can kill things without even having them in your sight.
You can kill enemies that are shooting at you while you're dealing with another enemy.
You can be extremely powerful and quick to kill everything in an area if the circumstances are in your favor.
You don't need a gun that's your level to kill enemies.
Great synergy with the Sham.
While Situational, it can be stronger than Pelt, which I feel balances it out.
Maybe more.

Cons:
It's a bit situational. You have to be against enemies with Guns.
It takes longer to kill enemies that don't have guns using this skill than with Pelt.
Maybe more.


Pelt:
Shoot one more Projectile per point at the cost of 10% slower fire rate per point.

Pros:
Higher DPS when taking everything into consideration.
You can deal far more damage in only a slight bit more time.
Lowers the lowest level requirement for your guns to be effective.
Extremely powerful in any situation.
The DPUH is even stronger with this than using Salvador?

Cons:
You still have to be firing at an enemy to deal damage.
Although not as situational, it can be weaker in some cases.

So there you go. Two skills with the same goal, with one being able to be stronger in some situations, and the other being a less situational strong one.
