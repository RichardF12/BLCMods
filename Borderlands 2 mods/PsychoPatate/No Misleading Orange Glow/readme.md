### No Misleading Orange Glow V.1.1 (17/12/18) by PsychoPatate
---

#### Intro
So, for some reason, Quartz, Emerald and Garnet Weapons have an orange glow when non-elemental.  
I don't understand why, it's not prettier, it's just misleading.  
So this simple mod changes (or removes) that glow.

#### PsychoPatch
This mod is now included in my **PsychoPatch**, which is a bundle of visual changes I made.
