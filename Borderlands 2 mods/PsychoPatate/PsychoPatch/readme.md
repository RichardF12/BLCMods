### PsychoPatch V.1.1 (10/01/19) by PsychoPatate
---

#### Intro
Bundle of tweaks and fixes mainly for visual stuff.

#### DISCLAIMER
It is **not** meant to replace the Unofficial Community Patch, I suggest to use it in **addition** to the UCP.

#### Changes list
Because the PsychoPatch is mainly visual changes, it's better to **look** at the changes rather than reading them, so here is a link to an album picturing most of the changes (but not all of them) :

**Correct E-Tech Launchers Skins :**
- Using BLCMM, you can choose if you want a "material change" or "skin change"
- Skin change won't give the exact purple rarity skin, but your already existing E-Tech launchers won't be deleted
- Material change will give the exact correct skin, but loading a save that already has E-Tech launchers will delete these launchers
- The skins from "skin change" are the same as UCP 4.1, except for the bandit one, which I modified

**No Misleading Orange Glow :**
- Changes the orange glow on some non elemental weapons
- Using BLCMM, you can choose if you want to change the color (listed below) or totally remove the glow
- Bandit Purple Rarity glow is now closer to yellow and the glowing is slightly weaker
- Bandit Gemstone (Quartz) now has a red-pink glow
- Dahl Gemstone (Emerald) now has a light green glow
- Vladof Gemstone (Garnet) now has a dark red glow
- Standalone mod **[here](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/PsychoPatate/No%20Misleading%20Orange%20Glow)**

**Proper Weapon Bodies :**
- Swaps the Green and Blue rarity bodies of pistols and some shotguns because it makes more sense
- Standalone mod **[here](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/PsychoPatate/Proper%20Weapon%20Bodies)**
