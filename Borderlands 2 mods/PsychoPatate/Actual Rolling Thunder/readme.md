### Actual Rolling Thunder V.1.0 (24/08/18) by PsychoPatate
---

#### Intro

In my opinion, there are 2 reasons why the Rolling Thunder sucks.  
The first one being the fact it's Rubberized,  
the second is that it stops bouncing when an ennemy is hit.  
Bouncing is the whole point of this grenade, so why should it stop ?  
This mod makes it bounce non-stop.

#### What does it do ?

It changes the rolling thunder to make it decent (yes, really).  
Here is what I changed :
- It no longer stops and explodes when an ennemy is hit
- It is no longer a MIRV grenade, that means it only explode once at the end
- It has 50% more damages
- Its blast radius is bigger (something like 200 more)
- It has a fixed fuse time of 100 secondes (but it doesn't actually matter as the bouncing duration hasn't changed)
