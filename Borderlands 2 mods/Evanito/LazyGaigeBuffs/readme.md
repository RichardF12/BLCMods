# Lazy Gaige Buffs by Evanito

Features:

- Toggleable buff to the Conference Call legendary shotgun to make it fill a room with bouncy ball bullets.
- Toggleable buff to Ricochet to remove the damage penalty and make it give 20% chance per level instead of 10%
- Toggleable QOL to toggle Deathtrap with same key as summon
- Toggleable buff to make Deathtrap last infinitely (only limited by HP)

Yeah, this mod isn't balanced. It's pretty fun though.

If you yoink some code at least give a shoutout to me.
