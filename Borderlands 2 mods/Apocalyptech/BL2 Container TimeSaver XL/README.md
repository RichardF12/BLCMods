BL2 Container TimeSaver XL
==========================

Are you a busy, on-the-go Vault Hunter who just doesn't have the
*time* for such luxuries as waiting for loot chests to open?  Are
those Hyperion weapon crates leaving you tapping your watch and
sneaking glances at your day calendar?  Is the hunt for more ammo
filling you with near-terminal waves of impatience?

Well, fret no longer!  This mod increases the opening animations
of all containers in BL2 by 5x.

There are, actually, two things which this mod does *not* alter:

 * The loot car at the end of the How Marcus Saved Mercenary Day
   Headhunter pack.  It's fun enough to watch that one open up at
   regular speed, and the seconds-per-loot ratio is already good
   enough.
 * This doesn't improve the initial digistruct speed for the weapon
   chests you can purchase in Digistruct Peak.  The container will
   still auto-open at a faster rate, though.

Usage/Installation
==================

This mod must be imported into BLCMM using `File -> Import single mod`.
Choose the file `BL2 Container TimeSaver XL.blcm` and have at it!

Bugs
====

Sound effects for the containers haven't changed at all, and still
use their pre-speedup timing.  So especially on the larger chests,
you'll probably get sound effects a second or two after the chest
is already opened.

TODO
====

v1.0.0 of this mod missed a few things needed for two chests
from the Scarlett DLC, containing pieces of the compass needed
to get through the mission quests.  Obviously my generation of
this thing missed those, so it's possible it missed some others.
Should do a more thorough search through the data to find out
if there's anything else I missed.  (Also I should move over
to using TPS-style delay modifications instead of just setting
nearly everything to zero, really.)
