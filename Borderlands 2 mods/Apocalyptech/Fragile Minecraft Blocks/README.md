Fragile Minecraft Blocks
========================

Causes the Minecraft blocks (in the little secret area of Caustic Caverns) to
be extremely fragile.  Damage of any sort will destroy them immediately now:
a single melee strike will do, but also guns, grenades, and anything else.

Happy mining!

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.2**, November 6, 2018:
 * Figured out a way to allow splash damage to destroy the blocks as
   well, actually!  A very short-lived v1.0.1, it seems.

**v1.0.1**, November 6, 2018:
 * Updated README and description, to reflect that area-effect damage
   still won't affect these blocks.  I don't think there's anything I
   can do about that, alas.

**v1.0.0**, November 4, 2018:
 * Initial public release
