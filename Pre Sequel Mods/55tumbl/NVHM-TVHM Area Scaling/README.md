# Overview

NT-AreaScaling makes all areas and side-missions progressively scale up according to your advancement in the main mission, in Normal mode and TVHM. Level restrictions on the DLCs are lifted, so they can be played anytime during NVHM/TVHM, and they will also scale up according to the progress in the main game story.

This means that you should for example be able to go back and farm RedBelly for a Striker at level 18. Or start Claptastic Voyage at level 8, do a couple missions before coming back to the main game, and return to finish the DLC at level 28. Unlike UVHM, the areas/missions will not always be exactly at your level (but close enough, as long as you keep up with the main story). However, NT-AreaScaling does not change anything else about the Normal and TVHM playthroughs and their balance.


# Compatibility

NT-AreaScaling should be compatible with any other mods, as long as these mods do not touch the area level definitions (I don't know of any mod that does, but I don't know everything).

NT-AreaScaling can be applied before loading any save game: it should automatically scale up the relevant areas. If you reload the save later on without NT-AreaScaling, the areas will go back within the acceptable limits in vanilla.

It is a relatively big file, so it may take a few seconds to load. The DLC sections may be disabled at will using BLCMM (in case you don't own some of the DLCs, or if you don't want to play them with the NT-AreaScaling modifications). NT-AreaScaling does absolutely nothing in UVHM, so there's not much point loading it when playing in UVHM.


# Detailed changes

## Normal mode

* Turning in one of the main story missions (not all of them, but most) will make all previous areas and non-accepted side missions scale up to your level, within certain limits (for example, after finishing Science and Violence, all areas should scale up to 19-21).
* Some areas will scale up directly, **others may require a save/quit**.
* Missions that have already been accepted (and their rewards) will never scale up, but the areas in which they take place, and the enemies you fight, should scale up.
* Finishing the main story and killing the Sentinel will make all areas scale up to level 28 (at least, certain areas may be a bit higher).
* The mission The Bestest Story Ever Told (Invincible Sentinel) will be between level 28 and 32 (depending on your level when you finish the main story). Completing this mission should make all areas scale up to 32 (at least, certain areas may be a bit higher).
* Some areas like Sublevel 13 have a special behavior in the vanilla game, which is mostly conserved here. But they will also scale to 28/32 after killing the Sentinel/Invincible Sentinel.

**DLCs**
* The DLCs (Claptastic Voyage and Holodome) will scale to your level when you first travel to the area, at any level between 5 and 35.
* Progress in the main game story should in principle scale up the already visited areas in the DLC.

## TVHM

* Essentially the same thing. Finishing the main story and killing the Sentinel will make all areas scale up to level 50, as in vanilla.

**DLCs**
* The DLCs will scale to your level when you first travel to the area, at any level between 30 and 50.
* Progress in the main game story should scale up the already visited areas in the DLC, same system as in Normal mode.
