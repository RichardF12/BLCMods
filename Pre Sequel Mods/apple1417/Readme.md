### Experimental
As the name might suggest, contains experimental changes which you probably shouldn't run if you don't know what you're doing.

### Grenade Status Chance Displayer
Shows the status effect chance on grenades.    
Note that just like weapons, the exact chance varies based on the health type (flesh/shield/armour) you use it on, so it won't always be completely accurate.

### Higher Level Scaling Remover
Removes various forms of scaling that happen when there is a large level difference between you and your enemy.

### Fast Travel Helper
Allows you re-enable the previously one-way only fast travel stations and lets you move them to any map without a station.    
Also has a few QoL changes to go along with these new stations:
- Re-orders the station order so that 00773 Vault Excavation Site comes right after Cluster 00773, rather than at the end of the list
- Re-enables the level transition from the Lunar Launching Station to the Eye of Helios
- Lets Flameknuckle respawn
- Lets Zarpedon respawn, optionally skipping the powersuit phase and adding its drops to the second phase

### Item Level Uncapper
This mod is useless by itself, it should be used alongside the hexedit to increase the player level cap.    
Fixes the level cap of most items so that they continue spawning past level 100.    
Note that items past level 127 will overflow upon save-quit, and that gibbed won't let you create items past 127, so past that point you'll have to pick up everything you use within the same session.    
Also note that there may still be various other issues with an increased level cap, this only fixes that most items stopped spawning.
