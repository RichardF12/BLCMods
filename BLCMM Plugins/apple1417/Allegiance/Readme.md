### Allegiance Forcer
This plugin generates a mod that forces allegiance towards one or more particular manufacturers. Weapons, shields, grenade modes, relics, and oz kits of incorrect manufacturers will be replaced with money drops, while class mods will still spawn but be unequippable.

Optional settings include:
- Applying  ontop of any mods you already have (required to properly remove modded drops)
- Allowing the relevant allegiance relic
- Increasing the value of money drops (as by default the money drops are worth less than the weapons they replace)
- Increasing the amount of useable items dropped

Supports both BL2 and TPS.

THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THIS DELETES ITEMS ON EXISTING CHARACTERS.    
I've tried to prevent everything but certain individual items may still be deleted. Making sure you only ever execute the patch when you have your allegiance character selected will prevent this.
