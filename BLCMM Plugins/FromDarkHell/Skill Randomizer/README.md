This is the BLCMM plugin implementation of BL2 / TPS Skill Randomizer.
This now has TPS support compared to the old, now deprecated skill randomizer.

## What does this thing do?

Randomization Chance ( ![Randomization Chance](https://puu.sh/BZbT7/26497a175c.png) )
  The chance a skill has to randomize.
  
Randomize Points for next tier ( ![Points For Next Tier](https://puu.sh/BZbWs/cc687f8cfa.png) )
  Randomizes the points for the next tier, if a skill has 2 skills, the number will be between 0 and the total amount of points for the skill.

Randomize Layout ( ![Layout Randomized](https://puu.sh/BZbXY/96467f16d3.png) )
  Randomizes the layout of the skill tree creating things like: ![Skills](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/446105169055318027/510593338869678080/unknown.png)
