This is the Times X Spawns mod generator.
It generates more elaborate versions of the x4 spawns mod

This means you get to fight more enemies.
The mod is meant to be played after the story / quests are completed.
Many quests may work fine with the generated mods, but expect softlocks.

This mod does *not* remove the spawn limit.
That means that if you make a x50 spawns, you will still only fight approximately 20 enemies at any given time.
If you want to fight all your spawns at the same time, (and die), also use the NoSpawnLimit mod in [my folder](https://github.com/BLCM/BLCMods/tree/master/Borderlands%202%20mods/LightChaosman).
